    Multi-variable problem. Used internally by RandObj.

    :param vars: The dictionary of names and :class:`RandVar` instances this problem consists of.

        problem before giving up.
    :param max_domain_size: The maximum size of domain that a constraint satisfaction problem
        may take. This is used to avoid poor performance. When a problem exceeds this domain
        size, we don't use the ``constraint`` package, but just use ``random`` instead.
        For :class:`MultiVarProblem`, we also use this to determine the maximum size of a
        solution group.
