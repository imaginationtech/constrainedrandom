    This is a very strange workaround for a very strange issue.
    ``copy.deepcopy`` can handle a ``partial`` for all other members
    of ``random.Random``, but not ``getrandbits``. I.e. it correctly
    copies the other functions and their instance of ``random.Random``,
    but not ``getrandbits``. The reason for this is unknown.

    This function therefore exists to work around that issue
    by getting ``getrandbits`` and calling it. I tried many
    other approaches, but this was the only one that worked.

    :param getter: Getter to call, returning an object that
        has a member function with name ``member_fn``.
    :param member_fn: Member function of the the object returned
        by ``getter``.
    :param args: Arguments to supply to ``member_fn``.

class RandVar:
    '''
    Randomizable variable. For internal use with :class:`RandObj`.

    :param name: The name of this random variable.
    :param _random: Provides the random generator object this instance will use to
        create random values. Either provide an existing instance of a :class:`Random`,
        or leave as ``None`` to use the global Python `random` package.
    :param order: The solution order for this variable with respect to other variables.
    :param domain: The possible values for this random variable, expressed either
        as a ``range``, or as an iterable (e.g. ``list``, ``tuple``) of possible values.
        Mutually exclusive with ``bits`` and ``fn``.
    :param bits: Specifies the possible values of this variable in terms of a width
        in bits. E.g. ``bits=32`` signifies this variable can be ``0 <= x < 1 << 32``.
        Mutually exclusive with ``domain`` and ``fn``.
    :param fn: Specifies a function to call that will provide the value of this random
        variable.
        Mutually exclusive with ``domain`` and ``bits``.
    :param args: Arguments to pass to the function specified in ``fn``.
        If ``fn`` is not used, ``args`` must not be used.
    :param constraints: List or tuple of constraints that apply to this random variable.
        Each of these apply only to the individual values in the list, if a length is
        specified.
    :param constraints: List or tuple of constraints that apply to this random variable.
        Each of these apply across the values in the list, if a length is specified.
    :param length: Specify a length > 0 to turn this variable into a list of random
        values. A value of 0 means a scalar value. A value >= 1 means a list of that length.
    :param max_iterations: The maximum number of failed attempts to solve the randomization
        problem before giving up.
    :param max_domain_size: The maximum size of domain that a constraint satisfaction problem
        may take. This is used to avoid poor performance. When a problem exceeds this domain
        size, we don't use the ``constraint`` package, but just use ``random`` instead.
    :param disable_naive_list_solver: Attempt to use a faster algorithm for solving
        list problems. May be faster, but may negatively impact quality of results.
